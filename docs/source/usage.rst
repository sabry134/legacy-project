Setting up Area
=====================

This documentation provides instructions for setting up and running the "Area" project. The project utilizes a web application built with React, so we'll also include instructions for installing the required dependencies and starting the development server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: `Download and install Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_

Clone the Repository
---------------------

First, you need to clone the "Area" project repository from the Epitech GitHub repository. Open your terminal and run the following command::


>>> git clone git@github.com:EpitechPromo2026/B-DEV-500-PAR-5-1-area-aurelien.duval.git

This command will create a local copy of the project on your machine.

Navigate to the Docs Directory
-------------------------------

Change your working directory to the "docs" folder within the cloned project directory using the ``cd`` command::

>>> cd web


Install Dependencies
---------------------

To install the required dependencies for the React web application, use the following command::

>>> npm install

This command will fetch and install all the necessary Node.js packages specified in the ``package.json`` file.

Start the Development Server
------------------------------

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the following command::

>>> npm start


This command will start the development server and open the "Area" web application in your default web browser. You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
-----

You can now use the "Area" web application to perform various tasks and actions as per the project's requirements.
