Welcome to the documentation for the "Area" project! Area is a versatile automation platform that allows you to create actions, reactions, and triggers to automate various tasks similar to Zapier. This guide will walk you through the deployment of the "Area" project and explain how to create and trigger workflows.


Language
----------

***Phoenix***

*Advantages:*

- Powerful tools under the MVC model (better distribution of tasks).

- High productivity (high development capacity).

- High application performance.

***Elixir***

*Advantages:*

- Scalability: Apps can run on multiple communicating nodes, making it very easy to create large-scale web and mobile applications.

- Concurrency: Multiple user requests can be processed simultaneously in real-time without negative effects.

- Ease of use: Easy to read and write, with extensions for efficient data transformation.

- Fault tolerance: Safety mechanisms provided to allow operation even when problems occur, with immediate reporting of any failures for resolution.

- Active community: Help and knowledge sharing through tutorials and complete documentation.

- Performance: Easier to adapt and create compared to Ruby, with excellent speed and response time, facilitating a fast learning curve. Clean code with modern syntax and modular structure instead of object and class.

*Disadvantages:*

- Requires knowledge of Erlang.

- Being a new language, it may lead to higher costs.

- Functional language.

***React JS***

*Advantages:*

- Simple to learn, especially for beginners.

- Virtual DOM improves performance.

- Ability to assemble multiple small components to create a larger user interface.

- Easy to test: React facilitates testing of interface code components, with the ability to run tests continuously on multiple browsers simultaneously.

- Open source with a very active community and public forums.

*Disadvantages:*

- Rapidly changing environment may require developers to frequently relearn codes.

***Flutter***

*Advantages:*

- Cost reduction: Developing a mobile app reduces development costs compared to simultaneously developing two native apps.

- Performance: Widget Component creates a canvas and draws the widgets; only the canvas will be translated into the native language, ensuring similar performance on Android and iOS.

- Development rendering engine in C++ provides better performance than React Native development in JavaScript.

- Built-in automated testing system.

*Disadvantages:*

- Limitation: Cannot exceed the performance of a native language app.

- Being a young language, there are fewer developers able to use it, resulting in a smaller community, although it is growing.
